# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Introduction
This Kaggle competition, "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster," challenges participants to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not based on various passenger attributes such as age, gender, and ticket class. It's a great introduction to machine learning and data analysis.

## Data
The dataset for this competition contains information about passengers, including whether they survived or not. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set for model evaluation.

## Goal
The primary objective is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the survival outcome for passengers in the test set.

## File Descriptions
- `train.csv`: The training dataset with labeled survival outcomes.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset where you need to make predictions.
- `gender_submission.csv`: A sample submission file with the correct format.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated based on accuracy, i.e., the percentage of correctly predicted outcomes.

## Instructions
1. Download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page.
2. Use a Jupyter Notebook or any preferred data analysis tool to build and train your machine learning model.
3. Make predictions on the test set and format the results according to the guidelines provided.
4. Submit your predictions to Kaggle and see how well your model performs.
